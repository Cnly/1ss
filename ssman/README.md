# ssman

This is a tiny bash script that helps with the management (switching) of multiple Shadowsocks servers.

To set up, put `ssman` somewhere in a folder (say `~/ssman/`). Then, `cd` to `~/ssman/`, and do `git clone https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks`. Finally, `mkdir ~/ssman/servers`, and put your config files (json) inside the newly created `servers` folder.

Now try running `./ssman`.
