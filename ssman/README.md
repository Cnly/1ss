# ssman

This is a tiny bash script that helps with the management (switching) of multiple Shadowsocks servers.

To set up, put `ssman` somewhere in a folder (say `~/ssman/`). Ensure you have shadowsocks-libev installed. Then, `cd` to `~/ssman/`. Then, `mkdir ~/ssman/servers`, and put your config files (json) inside the newly created `servers` folder.

Now try running `./ssman`.
